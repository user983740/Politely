# git Commit & Push

Reviews changes, commits, and auto-pushes. If an argument is provided, it is used as the commit message; otherwise, the message is auto-generated by analyzing the changes.

## Procedure

1. Check changed files with `git status` (including untracked)
2. Check staged + unstaged changes with `git diff`
3. Reference recent commit style with `git log --oneline -5`
4. Analyze changes and compose a commit message:
   - **prefix**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `style:`
   - **scope** (optional): `(frontend)`, `(backend)`, `(deploy)`, `(docs)`
   - **format**: `<prefix>(<scope>): <one-line description>`
   - Example: `feat(backend): add email verification retry logic`
5. `git add` only related files (exclude sensitive files like .env)
6. Create commit (include Co-Authored-By)
7. Run `git push origin`
8. Verify final state with `git status`

## Precautions

- Never force push to the `main` branch
- Do not commit sensitive files such as .env, credentials
- If there are no changes, do not commit — just notify
